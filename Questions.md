3 Main Methods + Questions to Answer:

1. Time Series (ARIMA, Kalman):
    - Does the same trend fit the data well for our entire time series? If not, does this suggest the influence of certain economic policies?
    - How well can we predict future housing prices?
2. Clustering: 
    - This gives categories for states in the hierarchical model
    - Cluster based on percentage change in housing cost 
    - Also answers the question: What regions are most profitable for investment? Which housing markets are correlated to each other? If you want to diversify your investments by buying houses in uncorrelated markets, which states should you buy in?
3. Bayesian Hierarchy:
    - Which states are most profitable for home buyers (low intercept, high slope)?
    - How does demographic play into housing markets? (Does it affect how reactive the market is to shocks?)s
