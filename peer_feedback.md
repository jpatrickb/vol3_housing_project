To-do List:
- discuss more about the strengths and weaknesses of each method (each person can do this within their subsection)
- clean up the first two sections (paragraphs before methods)
- be more clear about statement of the question
- talk about reasons for linear interpolation and sampling bias in CPS data
- talk about how we tuned models (selected parameters) and comparing how well they worked (metrics?)
- built in evaluation for ARMA (models)
- incorporate metrics into the conclusions
- clearer transitions + section summaries (clear statement of results at the end of each section)
- put figures 5 and 6 together, add a short explanatory caption (same with figures 2 and 3)
- clustering as a pre-processing step, swap the order so clustering comes first
- find max number of clusters before singletons appear
- talk more about history, background, and importance of the project
